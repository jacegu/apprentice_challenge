Pedigree vs Awesomeness

Tom Preston-Werner gave the best definiton of what University is to professionals in the programming field during his interview on the Teach me to code podcast.


<p>I hear a few podcasts. I like listening people talk about programming while I'm having a walk or heading somewhere.</p>

<p>One of those podcasts is <a href="http://teachmetocode.com/podcast"><em>teach me to code</em></a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cmaxw">Charles Max Wood</a>. It's an awesome podcast about almost any topic that could be related to programming: from testing to hiring developers.</p>

<p>What's even more awesome is that Charles usually interviews <strong>really interesting</strong> people like Corey Haines, Dave Hoover, Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler... You can get an idea of the kind of people involved.</p>

<p>On the last issue of the podcast the interviewee was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, one of the <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> founders.</a>.</p>

<p>One of the questions Charles made was related to how Github hires developers. How they find talented professionals. Tom knocked my mind with <em>the best</em> reflection related to college degrees I have ever heard:</a></p>

<blockquote>I find résumés to be almost entirely useless. You send me a résumé and I'll be like... <strong>&laquo;congratulations&raquo;</strong>. You send me code... and now I'm interested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Honestly, I don't care where you went to school. I don't care where you worked before. I don't care about anything except, <strong>&laquo;are you awesome at what you do?&raquo;</strong>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And a lot of that comes from... probably half of us, and possibly more of us, don't have college degrees. I don't have one, Chris doesn't have one...</blockquote>

<blockquote>To us is more like... <strong>&laquo;What can you accomplish? What are you capable of? Opposite to what is your <u>pedigree</u>&raquo;</strong></blockquote>

<p>You can hear it from 01:04:00 answering Charles' question about recognizing talented developers. The exact moment Tom says what I'm quoting here is 01:06:40.</p>

<p> I'm going to get that quote tattooed on my butt. <em>Seriously</em>...
